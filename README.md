### What I learned

I was able to put into paractice the use of the display:flex property which I have come accross in so many online tutorials. I have finally
gotten a hang of it!

### Continued development

I certainly need to focus more on responsiveness. I was able to make it somewhat responsive but I know that with more pratice, I can do better.
